# Event Handling

* Event handling is making something happen

* How it happens?
  * An event is triggered and a callback function is invoked to make something happen
  * Javascript will ‘listen’ for things that happen inside of a browser, these things are events

* Types of events?
  * Most common events => 'Click (Mouse Click)', Key press, Form Submission
  * There is a list of js events:

* How do we tell a node/element to listen for an event?
  * Addeventlistener: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener>
  * Takes in two arguments: name of the event and callback function
  * We can also add an event to the element
